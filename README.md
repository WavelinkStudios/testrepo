# Wavelink Studios Tester Cydia Repo
This is a Cydia repo that I am using to test future updates to the public repo. This isn’t useful for anything except possibly being really buggy. If you’d like to add our public repo to Cydia, please go to https://wavelinkstudios.github.io/repo and tap “Add to Cydia”. The below is the done and to-do list for the repo.

# Things Done Here
-A home page for the repo site has been created
-Example Package has been created; formatted; and commented for template use
-BIDsXI package depiction has been created but needs finishing touches
-Test Package has been created to allow actual testing without breaking the template or real packages
-Repo Icon should now be the WL repo icon
-“All Packages” page has been created
-Search bar seemingly complete for “All Packages” page

# Things To Do Here
-Clean up and finalise all public facing pages before official public release
-Test Package needs the screenshots page fixed once a fix for the issues are figured out
-Test Package needs its own test images that aren’t from BIDsXI
-BIDsXI screenshots page needs fixed as it isn’t working exactly as intended
—Maybe instead of fixing the images I can force the view to be as large as the images? Not sure this would actually work
-Clean up extra files that are no longer needed when the project is done
—These include things like unnecessary F7 and reposi3 files as well as testing files and possibly backup files
-Possibly add a dark/light mode feature for the main github page or even possibly for people viewing the package in Cydia
—This seems to work in it’s own default F7 page but won’t function anywhere else for some reason
-Fix the issue with package depictions not having their own unique link and not being usable by cydia due to this
-Clean up and comment code as much as possible
