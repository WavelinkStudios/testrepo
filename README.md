# Wavelink Studios Tester Cydia Repo
This is a Cydia repo that I am using to test future updates to the public repo. This isn’t useful for anything except possibly being really buggy. If you’d like to add our public repo to Cydia, please go to https://wavelinkstudios.github.io/repo and tap “Add to Cydia”. The below is the done and to-do list for the repo.

# Things Done Here
-A basic home page for the repo site has been created but needs a some finishing touches
-Example Package has been created; formatted; and commented for template use
-BIDsXI package depiction has been created but needs finishing touches
-Test Package has been created to allow actual testing without breaking the template or real packages
-Repo Icon should now be the WL repo icon
-Basic “All Packages” page has been created
-Search bar seemingly complete for “All Packages” page

# Things To Do Here
-Make a more finalised home page for the repo site
-Test Package needs the screenshots page fixed once a fix for the issues are figured out
-Test Package needs its own test images that aren’t from BIDsXI
-BIDsXI screenshots page needs fixed as it isn’t working exactly as intended
—This seems to work properly on my X (screenshots are from a X) so maybe instead of fixing the images I can force the view to be as large as the images?
-Clean up packages files of the no longer needed reposi3 packages.
-Clean up extra files that are no longer needed when the project is done
—These include things like unnecessary F7 and reposi3 files as well as testing files and possibly backup files
-Possibly add a dark/light mode feature for the main github page or even possibly for people viewing the package in Cydia
—This seems to work in it’s own default F7 page but won’t function anywhere else for some reason
-Finalise the “All Packages” page
-Test using the full WL logo instead of the slightly enlarged version to see if it looks better or worse within Cydia
